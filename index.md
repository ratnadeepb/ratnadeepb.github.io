&nbsp;

Welcome! I'm Ratnadeep Bhattacharya, a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science, [George Washington University](http://www.gwu.edu/). I am part of the [Cloud Systems Lab](https://cloudlab.seas.gwu.edu/) and my advisor is [Prof. Timothy Wood](http://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/~timwood/wiki/doku.php). Prior to joining GWU, I worked in the industry for 12 years, across India, Middle East and UK, on various technologies. For the most part my job consisted of designing and building enterprise Data Centers.

### Research Interests
My research interested are mainly in the area of Data Center/Cloud/Edge systems and networking and NFV (Network Function Virtualization). Specifically, I am looking at using tools from machine learning and queueing theory to build better resource management solutions in cloud infrastructure.
